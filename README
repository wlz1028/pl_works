* Load balancer
  * start two bottle apps at 8081 8082 ports(also tested on launching 4 bottle apps on 4 different ports. Almost no improvement, becasue performance is limited by aws server hardware configs)
  * use pound to load balance. Traffic to port:80 will be randomly assigned to either 8081 or 8082 port
  * backend server comparison
    * Use tornado in frontend server(async server, very fast, facebook also use it)
    * Use default multithread server
    * using "ab" to send concurrent connection
    * Tonado and multithread server doesn't have significant difference
    * result: 4000 concurrent connection on page without database
              3000 concurrent connection on query page(with mongodb)
              see rpts/connection_test.txt
  * see deloy.sh for pound config setting
